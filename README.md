### Developing commons

Downloading CraftBukkit and SpartanAPI is necessary if you want to build the plugin to test anything, and is quite simple.


First, create a `lib` folder in `commons/src`. This is where we will put our downloaded artifacts.

Download Spigot [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/) and build the [1.8.8 version](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#1-8-8)

Download [SpartanAPI(download link)](https://vagdedes.com/spartan/api/SpartanAPI.jar)

Now put both obtained jars into the `lib` folder created earlier and reload the maven project to get everything to work
